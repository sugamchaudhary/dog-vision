    "# End-to-End Multi-class Dog Breed Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using Tensorflow 2.0 and Tensorflow Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem\n",
    "Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I'm sitting at the cafe and I take a photo of a dog, I want to know what breed of dog it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "The data we're using is form Kaggle's dog breed identification competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/overview/evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",
    "Some information about the data\n",
    "* We're dealing with images (unstructured data) so it's probably best we use deep learning/transfer learning.\n",
    "* There are 120 breeds of dogs (this means there are 120 different classes.)\n",
    "* There are around 10,000+ images in the training set (these images have labels).\n",
    "* There are around 10,000+ images in the test set (these images have no labels, because we'll want to predict them).\n"
