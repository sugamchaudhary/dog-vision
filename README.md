# Dog Vision

This project implements an end-to-end multi-class image classifier to identify dog breeds from images using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub. The actual code can be found in the `dog-vision.ipynb` notebook. For installation, refer to the `requirements.txt` file to install the necessary packages. The dataset used is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition, which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data).
